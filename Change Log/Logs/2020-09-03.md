- It is now possible to create alert rules in Archeo. Alert rules can be created to send out alerts based on a variety of filters, intervals and thresholds.

- Archo alerting uses Archeos powerful search system, making it user-friendly and supporting a large number of use cases. Alerts can be created both from within    the alert rules menu or directly from a search in the search interface. Triggered alerts can also be viewed from the alert rules menu. Currently alerts are sent by email, but more distribution channels are being worked on and will arrive soon.
- Searches can now be copied to the clipboard for easy sharing.
- Log steps can be created from the user interface making it easy to manually add information to or change the status of a transaction.
- A variety of bugs have been fixed.
