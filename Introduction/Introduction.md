# What is Archeo

In 2006 Communicate created Message Tracking Monitor. This is an on-premise solution that gives customers logging and control over their business processes, integrations and corresponding messages.

Archeo is built on the mindset of Message Tracking Monitor and the knowledge of the challenges businesses face in day to day operations. In a world where theres ever-increasing demand for digital transformation, having good overview, logging and insight of the business becomes more and more important.

Archeo is a cloud-based solution. It does not require any on-premise installations or pre-requisites. All information provided to Archeo is done through a REST-based API. A cloud based portal is available for accessing all information logged and searching for your business processes, getting your statistics and configuration.

The user interface is designed to make anyone in your organization able to use this service, and one of the main goals is that the end users such as application and system owners can follow up on their own business processes and messages.
