## What is Archeo

Archeo is a cloud-based business and message tracking service. The service is developed by Communicate Norge AS, based in Halden, Norway.

Communicate has long experience developing software to support integrations between systems, and integration has been their core business for the last 20 years. In 2006 Communicate developed Message Tracking Monitor (MTM). This is a on premise solution to give customers control over their messages and integrations.

Archeo is based on Message Tracking Monitor and the knowledge of the challenges businesses have to get a good overview and insight of their business processes.

We know that in a fast growing and rapid changing environment, where there are many applications, it is difficult to get the overview and follow up messages and information flow in the systems.

Archeo offers a way to log data and messages giving the user insight and overview over all the business processes and offers easy and effective search capabilities. This includes free text search in all content, and a broad selection of filters.

Archeo is a cloud-based solution. It does not require onsite environment or prerequisites. All information provided to Archeo is done by a REST API. A cloud based portal is available for following up and searching for your business processes, getting your statistics and setting up your logging.

The user interface is designed to make anyone in your organization able to use this service, and one of the main goals is that the end users, can follow up their own business processes and messages.

Let your users only access what they need to see by setting role based and user group rights. This includes the possibility to restrict the user to open the file content of a message in your business process.

Track your first message in minutes, with the easy accessible REST API. You will be up and running in minutes.
