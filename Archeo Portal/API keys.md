## About API Key

API key is mandatory to use when logging to Archeo API (<https://api.archeo.no/swagger>). The API key holds the information about the subscription, and an not valid key will be refused. You may create as many keys as desired, but the rule of the thumb is to keep it to a minimum, due to security. 

## Generate API Key
To create a new key give it a name at click "Add". An existing key may be edited, deleted or activated/deactivated
