## About configuration API
Archeo supports configuration by API. It currently supports configuration of transaction types, message types and statuses. This functionality allows a more flexible configuration experience as part of automated systems and deployment procedures. Go to <https://api.archeo.no/swagger/> for all details. You will need a API key to use this API. The API Key is created in the Archeo Portal see [API Keys](../Archeo%20Portal/api%20keys.md/#generate-api-key)
